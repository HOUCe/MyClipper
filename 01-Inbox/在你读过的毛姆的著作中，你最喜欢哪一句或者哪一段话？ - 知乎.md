# [在你读过的毛姆的著作中，你最喜欢哪一句或者哪一段话？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/29674819/answer/1975908743)

太多啦，毕竟毛姆出了名的犀利。

最近在读的《月亮与六便士》里，深刻感受到他的刻薄、毒舌，中间还带着丝丝俏皮。

**关于人生际遇：**

  
Life isn't long enough for love and art.

生命苦短，不够时间既谈恋爱又搞艺术。

  
I recognised its social values, I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if I could only have change—change and the excitement of the unforeseen.

我承认这种生活有其社会价值，我明白循规蹈矩未必不是幸福。但血气方刚的我想踏上更为狂野不羁的旅途。我认为我应该提防这些安逸的欢乐。我心里渴望过上更危险的生活。我随时愿意奔赴陡峭险峻的山岭和暗流汹涌的海滩，只要我能拥有改变——改变和意料之外的事物带来的刺激。

  
I don't think of the past. The only thing that matters is the everlasting present.

我不想从前。最重要的是永恒的此刻。

**关于人性：**

It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.

痛苦使人高尚这种说法并不符合事实，幸福偶尔会使人高尚，但至于痛苦，在大多数情况下，只会使人卑鄙和恶毒。

The world is hard and cruel. We are here none knows why, and we go none knows whither.

世道艰难，人心险恶。我们不知道自己何以会来到人世，也不知道死后将会去往何方。

It was a night so beautiful that your soul seemed hardly able to bear the prison of the body.

那个夜晚是如此的美好，乃至你的灵魂似乎再也忍受不了身体的束缚。

Unconsciously, perhaps, we treasure the power we have over people by their regard for our opinion of them, and we hate those upon whom we have no such influence.

也许在潜意识里，我们很希望能够通过我们的看法去左右别人的行为，因而会憎恨那些不受我们影响的人。

Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem.

有时候人们戴的面具太过完美，日久天长之后，他们也就真的变成他们假扮的那个人。

The Prime Minister out of office is seen, too often, to have been but a pompous rhetorician, and the General without an army is but the tame hero of a market town.

人们常常发现，离任的总理原来只是个能言善辩的口舌之士，卸职的将军也无非是个软弱可欺的市井之徒。

**对于感情：**

She had a real passion for reading, and she invented a world of the imagination in which she lived with a freedom she never acquired in the world of every day.

她是真正热爱阅读的，她创造了虚幻的世界，高高兴兴地在里面生活，享受着她在日常世界得不到的自由。

  
It is one of the defects of my character that I cannot altogether dislike anyone who makes me laugh.

我的性格有个缺点，就是无法真的讨厌能让我发笑的人。

It seems to me that when vanity comes into love it can only be because really you love yourself best.

我觉得如果你在谈恋爱的时候还讲自尊心，那原因只有一个，其实你最爱的是你自己。
